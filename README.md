# T-SQL
Transact SQL Query Language
One of the most important Scripting Language that probably helps in data extraction, transformation, and preprocessing at a huge scale. 
As I have grown with my SQL skills, found some of these Reading Materials extremely resourceful. 

Apart from Query writing styles which I borrowed from the course that I completed in LinkedIn Learning, I have found that nothing can replace the real life learning scenario at work place. 

Starting with writing simpler Queries to eventually writing Complex Queries might sometime delay the computing powers and delay the query results. I found *Performance Tuning with DMVs* to be extremely handy while tuning some of my heavily Indexed Queries. Apart from that Partitioning along with Page Compression also helped a lot in terms of improving my SQL's performance. 

Last but not the least, every data is unique and are meant to address specific business solutions. So applying prudence to deal with the data is something that has to be tested before implementing any of the performance tuning queries.
